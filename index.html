        <h2>This architecture series was created as a project for Design Fundamentals in order to familiarize myself with Adobe Illustrator. For this project I was only allowed to use 5 colors and photos from around campus that I had taken myself. This project uses very simple shapes and colors in order to create depth and dimension that would exist in the real world. This was a very simple and tedious project but displays the beauty in the architecture around us that would typically go unnoticed.
